# Trademaster-Electron (Ultimatum) [Under development]
Trademaster is an overlay tool for the game Path of exile with functions to give the player better play experience.

To show the window after hiding type CommandOrControl+Q or click show option from the tray.

Working for Ultimatium, but still missing some key features.
Currently working on windows (tested) and mac (should, but did not test)
For setup files go the release page.

This is a totaly rework and redesign with the same, new and better features for my tool (https://github.com/StefanKunde/TradeMaster_POE) with electron.
