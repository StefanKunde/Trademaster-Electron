# Trademaster-Electron (Ultimatum) [Ready to use but still under development]
Trademaster is an overlay tool for the game Path of exile with functions to give the player better trading experience.

To show the window after hiding type CommandOrControl+Q or click show option from the tray.

Working for Ultimatium, but still missing some key features.
Currently working on windows (tested) and mac (should, but did not test).
Download here (https://github.com/StefanKunde/Trademaster-Electron-Path-of-exile-tool/releases).

Working features:
- Auto update (on restart app)
- League selection
- Bulk buys/sells
- Minimizing / resizing
- Show app after minimize via tray or CommandOrControl+Q
- Send trademessage by button click
- Buy currency
- Buy prophecies
- Buy Cards
- Buy fossils/resos
- Buy fragments
- Buy scarabs
- Buy essences
- Buy maps (all tiers, blighted and uniques)

Missing features -> under development:
- Set max price per item
- Add map search filter ( influences, enchantments, ...) 
- Many more...

This is a totaly rework and redesign with the same, new and better features for my tool (https://github.com/StefanKunde/TradeMaster_POE) with electron.
